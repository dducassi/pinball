An attempt at creating a pinball game:

- Includes ball mechanics, accounting for gravity
- Ball can bounce off of circular bumpers (obstacles), reflects from any angle
- Ball responds to flippers as rectangles, reflects based on flipper angle
- Left and right blocks funnel ball toward the flippers, bounces based on 45 degree angle (or vertical walls)
- Walls and blocks have speed debuff, while bumpers and flippers (when active) boost speed
- Bumpers change colors when hit
- Includes score mechanic for every time ball hits bumper, resets when ball falls through
- Ball resets with randomized velocity at top of board
- Does not yet include a plunger system
