An attempt at creating a pinball game:

- Includes ball mechanics, accounting for gravity
- Ball can bounce off of circular bumpers (obstacles), reflects from any angle
- Ball responds to flipper line, but doesn't yet calculate angle of reflection
- Left and right blocks funnel ball toward the flippers
- Walls and blocks have speed debuff, while bumpers boost speed
- Bumpers change colors when hit
- Includes score mechanic for every time ball hits bumper, resets when ball falls through
- Ball resets with randomized velocity at top of board
- Does not yet include a plunger system
